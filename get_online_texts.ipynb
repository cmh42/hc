    "Being able to retrieve online texts $-$ books etc. $-$ can be very useful when it comes to testing functions that process strings or for example if you want to establish results about the frequency of letters (or characters) used in English. For example you may want to extract texts from files published on line by **Project Gutenberg** (at <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org\">https://www.gutenberg.org</a>.)\n",
